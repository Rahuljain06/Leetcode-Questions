class Solution:
    def smallestDistancePair(self, nums: List[int], k: int) -> int:
        # We can design an enough function, given an input distance, determine whether there're at least k pairs whose distances are less than or equal to distance. We can sort the input array and use two pointers (fast pointer and slow pointer, pointed at a pair) to scan it. Both pointers go from leftmost end. If the current pair pointed at has a distance less than or equal to distance, all pairs between these pointers are valid (since the array is already sorted), we move forward the fast pointer. Otherwise, we move forward the slow pointer. By the time both pointers reach the rightmost end, we finish our scan and see if total counts exceed k. Here is the implementation:

        def enough(distance) -> bool:  # two pointers
            count, i, j = 0, 0, 0
            while i < n or j < n:
                while j < n and nums[j] - nums[i] <= distance:  # move fast pointer
                    j += 1
                count += j - i - 1  # count pairs
                i += 1  # move slow pointer
            return count >= k
# Obviously, our search space should be [0, max(nums) - min(nums)]. Now we are ready to copy-paste our template:
        nums.sort()
        n = len(nums)
        left, right = 0, nums[-1] - nums[0]
        while left < right:
            mid = left + (right - left) // 2
            if enough(mid):
                right = mid
            else:
                left = mid + 1
        return left
